# Rendering pipeline

PHP renders placeholder markup; `build/view.js` then mounts the upstream React `LogoSoup` component on each mount node and replaces it with the normalized row. The block and every shortcode share one renderer and one view script. This shape won the June 2026 SAR run ([[sar-review]], "Candidate C").

## Steps

1. **Render (PHP).** The block's `render_callback` and the shortcode handler both call `COOPBOLO_Renderer` (`includes/class-coopbolo-plugin.php`). It sanitizes attributes, resolves a collection if `collection`/`id` is set ([[logo-collections]]), and prints `.cb-lw-wrapper > .cb-lw-inner[data-cb-lw="<json>"]` with placeholder `<img>`s. Legacy `cb-balanced-logos*` classes and `data-cb-balanced-logos` are printed too (`class-coopbolo-renderer.php` ~line 265).
2. **Enqueue (PHP).** Rendering calls `COOPBOLO_Assets::enqueue_frontend()`. As an early pass, `maybe_enqueue()` on `wp_enqueue_scripts` checks the singular post with `has_block()` / `has_shortcode()` for all names and aliases, **plus the Bricks meta `_bricks_page_content_2`** (added in 1.2.4, `get_post_content_for_detection()`), so builder pages get assets in `<head>`.
3. **Hydrate (JS).** `src/view.js` finds `[data-cb-lw]` (or the legacy attribute), parses the JSON, and mounts with `createRoot`. A `WeakMap` stops a node from mounting twice. Carousels then fire `cb-lw-hydrated` (and the legacy `cb-balanced-logos-hydrated`).
4. **Normalize (library).** `logo-soup` loads each image into a canvas to measure it. That is why logo URLs must be same-origin or CORS-enabled (see [[gotchas]]). Lifecycle hooks from 1.3.0 clear the `cb-lw-soup-loading` class on success or failure ([[sanity-logo-soup]]).

## Why `block.json` has no `viewScript` or `style`

`block.json` declares only `editorScript` and `editorStyle`. Frontend JS/CSS is registered and enqueued by PHP so it loads only when something renders, and is never enqueued twice (once by core for the block, once by the shortcode path). The SAR attack round found the double-enqueue risk; `AGENTS.md` makes it a rule. Adding `viewScript` back breaks that rule. See [[0006-php-owned-asset-enqueue]].

## SSR markup matches the hydrated DOM

The Bricks builder canvas often does not run `view.js`. Since 1.2.1 (commit `1878ed6`), strip placeholders use the same shape LogoSoup produces after hydration: `.cb-lw-inner > div > span > img`. CSS aimed at `.cb-lw-inner > div > span` therefore works in the builder preview and on the live page. Changing the placeholder shape breaks designer CSS on RapidSOS ([[rapidsos-site]]).

## Editor and frontend parity

`src/shared/to-lw-props.js` (`toLwProps`, `sanitizePreviewConfig`) is the single JS sanitizer for the block preview, the collection admin preview, and the frontend. PHP mirrors the same rules (named-color allowlist, clamps, `densityFactor` 0 when `densityAware` is off). The allowlists in PHP and JS must stay in sync ([[sar-review]] caveats; [[adversarial-review]]).
