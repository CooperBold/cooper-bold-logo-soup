# RapidSOS site

RapidSOS is a Cooper Bold client WordPress site built with **Bricks** on Cloudways. The plugin was first built for its "software integrations" page. RapidSOS uses it through collections and the shortcode, not the Gutenberg block. Sources: Notion task; `docs/RAPIDSOS-DEPLOY.md`.

Before any Bricks or WPCode work on this site, read `~/.claude/rules/cooper-bold-wordpress.md`. Melanie owns layout. Use Bricks Style UI, not `_cssCustom` or pasted CSS.

## Facts

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Staging | Cloudways app `wordpress-1533060-6135168.cloudwaysapps.com` | `docs/RAPIDSOS-DEPLOY.md` |
| Live | Gets staging changes through **Cloudways Push**, which copies the database, including active WPCode snippets | RapidSOS audit 2026-08-13 |
| Plugin version on staging | **1.2.11**, old slug `cooper-bold-logo-soup` (Splide from jsDelivr; ships `composer-setup.php`) | RapidSOS audit 2026-08-13 |
| Pages | `/public-safety/software-integrations/` (origin request), `/public-safety/law-enforcement/`, `/commercial-building-safety/` | Notion task; `docs/RAPIDSOS-DEPLOY.md` |
| Main collection | "trusted public safety software partners", 70 logos (filled by a WPCode snippet) | RapidSOS `deploy/wordpress/logo-soup/README.md` |
| Slider integration | Bricks Nested Slider + footer snippet `rapidsos-logo-slider-fix` + slide class `logo-slider-slide` | [[carousel-and-splide]] |

Whether staging or live has moved past 1.2.11 since 2026-08-13 is *(unverified)*: nobody checked the live sites for this wiki.

## Upgrading the site from 1.2.x to 1.3.x

1.3.0 changed the folder, main file, text domain, REST namespace, and meta keys ([[0003-plugin-name-cooper-bold-logo-wrangler]]). The plugin keeps working for content: legacy shortcodes (`[logo_soup]`), legacy blocks, the CPT, and legacy meta all still work ([[logo-collections]]). Four things do not carry over:

1. **No loader exists for `cooper-bold-logo-soup.php`.** `balanced-logos.php` only covers the short-lived Balanced Logos path. Uploading the 1.3.x ZIP creates a second plugin folder, `cooper-bold-logo-wrangler/`. Deactivate the old plugin and activate the new one by hand. Both register `[logo_soup]`, so never run both at once.
2. **REST route moved** from `cb-logo-soup/v1/collections` to `cb-lw/v1/collections`. RapidSOS's `populate-collection.py` uses the old route.
3. **Meta keys:** the RapidSOS populate snippets write `_cb_logo_soup_logos`. After a collection is saved in 1.3.x, that key is deleted and ignored.
4. Purge Cloudways, Breeze, and Bricks caches after the switch ([[rapidsos-deploy]]).

Test on a local clone first (`wp-fleet local` / `wp-site`). Never upgrade the live site without Nicholas's go-ahead.
