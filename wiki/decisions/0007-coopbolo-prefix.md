# Rename the PHP prefix to coopbolo_ and migrate collections

**Status:** active. Built in 1.3.5 on branch `fix/coopbolo-prefix`, 2026-10-22; not uploaded yet.

## Why

The 2026-08-26 WP.org manual review flagged prefix "cb" as too short. Their tool reads a prefix up to its first underscore, so `CB_LW_Assets` and `CB_LW_VERSION` both count as "cb". They require 5+ characters and suggested `coopbolo`. 1.3.4 (uploaded 2026-10-21) still used `cb_lw_`, so it would fail again ([[wporg-review-thread]]).

## What changed

| Before (≤ 1.3.4) | 1.3.5 |
|---|---|
| Classes `CB_LW`, `CB_LW_*` | `COOPBOLO_Plugin`, `COOPBOLO_*` (files `includes/class-coopbolo-*.php`) |
| Functions `cb_lw_*`, defines `CB_LW_*` | `coopbolo_*`, `COOPBOLO_*` |
| CPT `cb_logo_collection` | `coopbolo_collection` (19 chars; the limit is 20) |
| Meta `_cb_lw_logos` / `_cb_lw_settings` | `_coopbolo_logos` / `_coopbolo_settings` |
| Nonce, form fields, list columns `cb_lw_*` | `coopbolo_*` |
| REST `cb-lw/v1/collections` | `coopbolo/v1/collections` |
| Admin handles `cb-lw-*` | `cooper-bold-logo-wrangler-*` |
| Debug flag `window.CB_LW_DEBUG`, `?cb_lw_debug=1` | `window.COOPBOLO_DEBUG`, `?coopbolo_debug=1` |

**Not renamed, on purpose:** frontend CSS classes (`.cb-lw-wrapper`, `.cb-lw-inner`, …), `data-cb-lw`, admin HTML ids, the `[logo_wrangler]` shortcode and its legacy aliases, and block names. Theme and Bricks CSS targets those classes, and saved content uses those tags. The WP.org rule covers PHP globals, options, and CPTs, not CSS.

## Migration

`COOPBOLO_Collections::maybe_migrate_legacy_data()` runs on `init` priority 20 until the option `coopbolo_schema_version` is 1. It uses `set_post_type()` and the post meta API, with no direct SQL, so caches stay valid and Plugin Check stays quiet. It covers every post status, trash included. The meta is copied, not moved, so `_cb_lw_*` stays until the next save and stays in the legacy read-fallback list. An existing `_coopbolo_*` key is never overwritten. See [[logo-collections]].

**Hardened after the pre-merge adversarial gate (2026-10-22):**
- It checks `get_post_type()` before each move, because a theme's `pre_get_posts` can make the lookup return ordinary posts.
- Old meta is kept, so a rollback doesn't empty collections.
- Non-array meta is skipped.
- The option is set only when every move succeeds.
- Deactivating the plugin deletes the option.
- The rollback steps are now in [[rapidsos-deploy]].

**Alternatives rejected:** a direct `UPDATE wp_posts` (Plugin Check warns on direct queries, and it skips cache invalidation), and keeping `cb_logo_collection` (the reviewer listed it by name).

## Verified (2026-10-22)

- **After the gate fixes:** PHPUnit 53 (4 new: hijacked query, non-array meta, failed move leaves the option unset, deactivate clears the option; the new tests fail when their fix is removed). In wp-env, the documented rollback took 1.3.5 back to 1.3.4 and the page still rendered, including the 1.3.5 edits. The re-upgrade, run with an mu-plugin whose `pre_get_posts` made the lookup return 4 pages and 2 posts, moved only the 4 collections and kept the old keys. Deactivating cleared the option. Plugin Check found no errors.
- PHPUnit 49 (5 new: migration, idempotency, existing-key guard, fallback, prefix guard for defines and CPT, meta, and option names). Jest 19. Build. JS lint at the known baseline (92).
- wp-env, WP 7.1-alpha, PHP 7.4: installed the 1.3.4 ZIP and created collections with it (publish, draft, trash, plus a legacy `_cb_logo_soup_*` one), then upgraded in place with the 1.3.5 ZIP. All four moved; the page render data was identical before and after (2 + 50 logos); a backslash in alt text survived; no PHP notices with `WP_DEBUG` on. The admin list, edit, and save flow worked through the new nonce and fields. REST `coopbolo/v1` returned 200 and `cb-lw/v1` returned 404.
- Fresh install on the clean tests site with `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` on: activate, render strip + carousel, empty `debug.log`.
- Plugin Check 2.0.0 on the installed 1.3.5 ZIP: no errors or warnings.

## Consequences

- Code and database versions must match from 1.3.5 on. Rolling back means changing the post type back with WP-CLI ([[rapidsos-deploy]] → Rollback checklist). A Cloudways database-only push of a 1.3.5 database onto 1.3.4 code empties every logo strip.
- Not handled: WXR imports of old `cb_logo_collection` exports (the importer skips unregistered post types), and per-user screen options or admin-menu rules keyed on the old post type.
- Outside scripts that query `cb_logo_collection` or `cb-lw/v1` (RapidSOS tooling) need the new names ([[rapidsos-site]]).
- Older pages in this wiki (decisions 0002–0006, sources) keep the `CB_LW_` names they had when written.
